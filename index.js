//   👉 2c. Create a function called describeItem, which should take in an item as a parameter (the argument handed to this function would be an item from our collection). The function should console.log a message according to how many of the item you have.

// For example, the result of calling the describeItem function with the first item in our collection would be: "I have a School of Code mug. Here's what I like about it: It has my cute pixel character on it!"

//Create a function that tkes in a parameter... myCollection

// include an if statment to check the how m
